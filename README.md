This repository contains a C++ code example demonstrating a common error when removing elements from a `std::vector` during iteration.  The `bug.cpp` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides the corrected version and explanation.  The issue arises from modifying the vector's size while iterating using an index-based loop. This can lead to out-of-bounds access or skipping elements. The solution demonstrates safer and more efficient ways to remove elements from a vector.
